# nrf8001-sandbox

Experiments mashing together a STM32F4 dev board and an nRF8001 dev board with the help of my
wrapper of the Nordic SDK: https://github.com/kesyog/nrf8001-arm.

Currently just runs the verification program that sends test echo commands to the nRF8001 chip and
verifies the return message. Saving my progress before I break everything again.
